Python benchmarks to try and recreate the results from this research paper: https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf using the Green Metrics Tool.

The benchmarks, which are the same used in the paper, were copied and slightly modified over from https://github.com/greensoftwarelab/Energy-Languages.

We are testing three different benchmarks from there (binary-trees, fannkuch-redux, and fasta) in C and a few different versions of python: 3.9, 3.12, RustPython, PyPy, and Mojo.
